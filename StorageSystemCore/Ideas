1: Instead of returning strings for the view/SQL-add/update returns objects and for sql check their type, if string add '' around the value.
	This does not fully work as a null string returns as an object rather than an object:string. Fixed by doing a type check on the property and value is null. 

2: When adding a ware to the SQL-database, start with adding the default values (name, id, amount, type) and then for each extra value check if the column exist. 
  2.1: If it does, just add the value that belongs to that column
  2.2: If it does not, add the column as nullable and then add the value.
